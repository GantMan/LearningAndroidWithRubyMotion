## Learning Android With RubyMotion

I'm reading through _[Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide,](http://www.amazon.com/Android-Program    ming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321804333/)_ and writing the code examples in Ruby rather than Java. This repo contains all of that code.

If you're interested in learning more about this project, you can follow along with [my blog series.](http://code.darinwilson.net/blog/2015/04/23/learning-android-with-rubymotion-introduction.html)

This is work-in-progress and a learning process, so I don't claim that every part of this is optimal. Comments, feeback, and pull requests are most welcome.
